## 💡 Tips for Success

### 1. **Don't Rush**
Take your time to understand each concept. It's better to spend 3 days truly understanding than 1 day memorizing.

### 2. **Experiment**
Break things! That's how you learn. The code is well-documented, so you can always refer back.

### 3. **Read Comments**
Every file has detailed comments. They explain not just WHAT the code does, but WHY.

### 4. **Use the Console**
Add `console.log()` everywhere to see data flow. Open browser DevTools (F12).

### 5. **Ask Questions**
If something is unclear, search for it in the documentation or Google it.

### 6. **Build Something**
The best way to learn is by building. Try the exercises in LEARNING_PATH.md.
